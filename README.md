# Toy Streamlit dict_input widget

A version of the Streamlit standard dict view that is editable would be handy for quick prototyping, for when an app has many parameters, and as a supplemental way to copy configuration in and out of a Streamlit app. Here is toy one to explore this.

Try it out on Streamlit's [share](https://share.streamlit.io/robwalton/streamlit-toy-dict-input) or locally with:

    $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
