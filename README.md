# Toy Streamlit dict_input component

A version of the Streamlit standard dict view that is editable would be handy for quick prototyping, for when an app has many parameters, and as a supplemental way to copy configuration in and out of a Streamlit app. Here is toy implementation and a Streamlit app to show how it works.

    $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
